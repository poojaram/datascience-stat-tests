# Part 2: Asses grade differences between men and women in an Informartics course

# Set up
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Load data


# How many students are there of each sex?


# Calculate averages for each assignment for each sex 
# Hint: use `summarize_all`


# Create a scatter plot showing the average female score (x) v.s. male score (y)
# Add a 45 degree line to the graph
# Hint: this requires reshaping


# Perform a T test on the "total" grade.
# Is there an observed and significant different by sex?


# Now run a t-test on each assignment (feel free to use a loop)


# Make histograms of a3 togther


# Was assignment 4 harder than assignment 5 (plot the difference)
