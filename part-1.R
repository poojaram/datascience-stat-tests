# Part 1: Generate random data to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem

# Create a "population" of 10,000 values, uniformly distributed between 0 and 100


# Draw a histogran of your population to view its shape


# Use the `sample` function to draw 100 value from the population (without replacement)


# What is the difference between the mean of your population and the mean of your sample?


# Now take 1000 samples from your population, keeping track of the mean of each sample. 
# Feel free to do this in a loop, or writing a function an using lapply


# What is the difference between the mean of your means and the populaiton mean?


# Draw a histogram of the means of your samples
